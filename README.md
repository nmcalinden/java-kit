## 📝 Topics Overview


### 1. Design & Architecture (`01-java-design-architecture-mastery.md`)  
**Level:** Intermediate → Advanced  
**High-Level:** Covers OOP principles, SOLID, design patterns, high cohesion/low coupling, composition vs aggregation vs association, caching, communication models, and architecture styles (DDD, Clean, Onion).  
**Purpose:** Prepare for system design interviews and writing maintainable, scalable Java applications.

### 2. Java Core Concepts (`02-java-core-concepts.md`)  
**Level:** Beginner → Advanced  
**High-Level:** Covers Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming, memory management, concurrency, generics, functional programming, streams, and data structures.  
**Purpose:** Build a strong foundation for backend development and technical interviews.

### 3. Spring / Spring Boot (`03-java-spring-boot.md`)  
**Level:** Intermediate → Advanced  
**High-Level:** Introduces IoC, Dependency Injection, Beans, Scopes, Spring annotations, REST API development, Spring Boot features, JPA/Hibernate, transactions, and error handling.  
**Purpose:** Master Spring framework for building enterprise-grade applications.

### 4. Databases (`04-databases.md`)  
**Level:** Beginner → Intermediate  
**High-Level:** Covers SQL fundamentals, joins, indexing, views, stored procedures, ETLs, pagination, partitions, and relational vs non-relational databases.  
**Purpose:** Ensure effective data modeling, query optimization, and data operations in backend systems.

### 5. Security (`05-security.md`)  
**Level:** Intermediate → Advanced  
**High-Level:** Explains authentication vs authorization, Spring Security, XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, OAuth 2.0 vs SAML, OWASP guidelines, and best security practices.  
**Purpose:** Equip developers to design and secure robust applications.

### 6. Messaging Systems (`06-messaging-systems.md`)  
**Level:** Intermediate → Advanced  
**High-Level:** Covers asynchronous communication, Kafka, RabbitMQ, JMS, delivery guarantees, idempotency, dead-letter queues, and Spring integration.  
**Purpose:** Design scalable, decoupled, and reliable systems.

### 7. Distributed Systems (`07-distributed-systems.md`)  
**Level:** Advanced  
**High-Level:** Focuses on CAP theorem, consistency models, consensus algorithms, fault tolerance, scalability, distributed transactions, event-driven architectures, and observability.  
**Purpose:** Prepare for system design interviews and real-world large-scale backend architectures.

### 8. Testing & Quality (`08-testing-with-quality.md`)  
**Level:** Beginner → Intermediate  
**High-Level:** Covers unit, integration, API, and contract testing, mocking strategies, test best practices, CI/CD integration, and code quality tools (SonarQube, JaCoCo).  
**Purpose:** Ensure reliability, maintainability, and high-quality production-ready code.

### 9. DevOps & CI/CD (`09-java-devops-ci-cd.md`)  
**Level:** Intermediate → Advanced  
**High-Level:** Introduces Java build tools (Maven, Gradle), CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, logging and monitoring, configuration management, and deployment best practices.  
**Purpose:** Enable developers to automate, deploy, and monitor Java applications effectively.
